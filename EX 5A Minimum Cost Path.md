# EX 5A Minimum Cost Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Python program using A Naive recursive implementation of Minimum Cost Path Problem.




## Algorithm
1. Base Case:If either row (m) or column (n) is out of bounds (i.e., less than 0), return a very large value (sys.maxsize) to signify an invalid path.
2. If both m == 0 and n == 0, return the cost of the starting cell cost[m][n].
3. Recursive Case:For every cell (m, n), calculate the minimum cost by considering three possible moves:
4. Move from the top-left diagonal (m-1, n-1).
5. Move from the top (m-1, n).
6. Move from the left (m, n-1).
7. For each direction, recursively compute the cost and add the current cell's cost.
8. Return the Minimum Cost:Recursively return the minimum of the three paths, adding the cost of the current cell.
9. Final Output:Call the recursive function starting from the bottom-right corner of the matrix to find the minimum cost.

            return sys.maxsize
        elif(m==0 and n==0):
            return cost[m][n]
        else:
            return cost[m][n] + min(minCost(cost,m-1,n-1),
                                    minCost(cost,m-1,n),
                                    minCost(cost,m,n-1))
    
    
cost= [ [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 8, 2],
        [1, 5, 3] ]
print(minCost(cost, R-1, C-1))
